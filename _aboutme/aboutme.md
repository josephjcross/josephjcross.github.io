# About Me

I appreciate your interest in who I am!

I am a humanist specializing in ancient Mediterranean literature, in particular the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Egyptian literature. My current position is a researcher on the European Research Council-funded project [From Texts to Literature: Demotic Egyptian Papyri and the Formation of the Hebrew Bible (DEMBIB)](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/dembib) at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; see the page for my [project](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/sub-projects/inventing-history-narrative-compositions-in-demotic-and-biblical-literature) and [subproject](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/sub-projects/inventing-history-narrative-compositions-in-demotic-and-biblical-literature/sub-project-1-2-historiographic-an-narrative-literature-demotic-texts) here, as well as [my team member page](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/research-team/dr-joseph-cross). I received my PhD in 2022 from the University of Chicago, Department of Near Eastern Languages, where I completed the doctoral programs in the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East as well as in Egyptology, specializing in Demotic. My dissertation was entitled “The Poetics of Plot in the Egyptian and Judean Novella.” Prior to Chicago, I studied classics and theology.

My forthcoming book is *The Poetics of Plot in the Judean and Egyptian Novella*, which will be published in the series Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis (early 2026).

My primary research interest is the literature of storytelling, both its poetics and its socio-cultural setting, specifically what Frederic Jameson calls its “political unconscious.” The kinds of questions that animate my readings are, you could say, transcendental: what allows certain genres or trends in poetics to have meaning and value for certain communities of authors and readers? How is the ancient experience of literature part of the experience of individuality, or group membership, or incorporation into larger world systems? How can we even define or approximate what that experience was, as moderns?

In my publications, I work from the perspectives of philology, narratology, and close reading to develop new readings in ancient (works of) literature and new perspectives on ancient (systems of) literature, and thereby try to suggest answers to these questions. My research has implications for wider, cross-disciplinary questions in ancient studies, such as the origin of the novel.

My other interests include the interaction and parallels between Ancient Egyptian culture and cultures of the Ancient Levant, including Israel and the Hebrew Bible and beyond. I am also interested in the practice of magic and its textual culture in ancient societies. Finally, I also actively engage in historicizing past literary criticism and histories of literature, especially in the disciplines of biblical studies and Egyptology, in the context of 18th-19th century intellectual history, and in theoretical currents of the 20th century.

Previously to working in Berlin, I was a Public Outreach and Content Specialist for the Education Department of the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures of the University of Chicago from 2015-2020, where I taught continuing education courses, gave public lectures on the Ancient Near East throughout the Chicago area, and provided expertise for the museum’s docent program. Additionally, I conducted research for the Chicago Demotic Dictionary and for the Critical Editions for Digital Analysis and Research project at ISAC. From 2016-2018, I taught in the Writing Program at the University of Chicago and won the Karen Dinal Memorial Award. From 2018-2020, at the University of North Carolina Asheville, I taught in the Dept. of Classics and in the Humanities Program. At the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, I recently taught a course (with my colleague Stefanie Eisenmann) a course entitled “Ancient Magic in Text and Archaeology.”
