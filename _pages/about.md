Hello!

I am a philologist and scholar of ancient literature, in particular the Hebrew Bible and Demotic Egyptian literature at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. My current position is as a researcher on the European Research Council-funded project [From Texts to Literature: Demotic Egyptian Papyri and the Formation of the Hebrew Bible (DEMBIB)](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/dembib); see the page for my [project](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/sub-projects/inventing-history-narrative-compositions-in-demotic-and-biblical-literature) and [subproject](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/sub-projects/inventing-history-narrative-compositions-in-demotic-and-biblical-literature/sub-project-1-2-historiographic-an-narrative-literature-demotic-texts) here, as well as [my team member page](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/research-team/dr-joseph-cross). I trained as a biblical scholar (Hebrew Bible/Old Testament) and Egyptologist at the University of Chicago, Department of Near Eastern Languages, and received my PhD in 2022. My dissertation was entitled “The Poetics of Plot in the Egyptian and Judean Novella.” Prior to Chicago, I studied classics and theology.

My primary research interest is the literature of storytelling, both its poetics and its socio-cultural setting. Currently, I am researching novellas in the Achaemenian and Hellenistic southeastern Mediterranean, especially Judean and Egyptian. Texts of particular centrality to my work at the moment are Esther and the Demotic narrative of P. Spiegelberg. I am in the process of finishing my first book, a substantial revision of my dissertation which will be called (probably) _The Poetics of Plot of the Egyptian and Judean Novella_. 

In my publications, I work from the perspectives of philology, narratology, and close reading and develop new readings in ancient literature. I am interested in developing critical approaches to storytelling literature from antiquity and beyond, and ultimately hope to contribute to new paradigms for critically encountering fiction in the ancient world cross-culturally. In support of this, I also actively engage in historicizing past literary criticism and histories of literature, especially in the disciplines of biblical studies and Egyptology, in the context of 18th-19th century intellectual history, and in theoretical currents of the 20th century. 

My other interests include the interaction and parallels between Ancient Egyptian culture and cultures of the Ancient Levant, including Israel and the Hebrew Bible. I am also interested in the practice of magic and its textual culture in ancient societies.

Previously, I was a Public Outreach and Content Specialist for the Education Department of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago from 2015-2020, where I taught continuing education courses, gave public lectures on the Ancient Near East throughout the Chicago area, and provided expertise for the museum’s docent program. Additionally, I conducted research for the [Chicago Demotic Dictionary](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/demotic-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago) and for the [Critical Editions for Digital Analysis and Research project](https://voices.uchicago.edu/cedar/) at the Oriental Institute. From 2016-2018, I taught in the Writing Program at the University of Chicago and won the Karen Dinal Memorial Award. From 2018-2020, at the University of North Carolina Asheville, I taught Latin in the Dept. of Classics and The Ancient World in the Humanities Program.
