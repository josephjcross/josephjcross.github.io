Hello! 

I am a humanist specializing in ancient Mediterranen literature, in particular the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Egyptian literature. Currently I am researcher at the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin with the European Research Council-funded project [From Texts to Literature: Demotic Egyptian Papyri and the Formation of the Hebrew Bible (DEMBIB)](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/en/dembib/dembib).

Read more about me and my research [here](/aboutme).
