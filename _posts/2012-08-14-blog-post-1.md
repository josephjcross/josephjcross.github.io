I succesfully defended my dissertation in late February and will soon be cast out from the coterie of the U of Chicago. Some exciting changes are on the horizon hopefully, but in the meanwhile, I am working on a few projects that have been put on hold. So keep an eye out for the following:

* A puiblished version of a paper I gave this time last year on mouvance in manuscripts of Demotic novellas, for the [Early Text Cultures reading group](https://www.earlytextcultures.org/). I'm extremely grateful to the editors of this volume in being patient with me.
* Finally writing up an official publication of the Samaritan manuscripts I rediscovered at the Oriental Institute, which I discussed in a short article for the OI's News and Notes [here](https://works.hcommons.org/records/p43ne-deq21/latest).
* Some book reviews I guess?

Stay tuned!
